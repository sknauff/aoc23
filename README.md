# Advent of Code 2023

My own solutions using Rust to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.

Each day has its own directory. `day00` is the blueprint used to setup a new day.

To execute the solution for a given day:

1. Ensure [Rust is installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

2. `cd` into directory of the day. E.g.,:

    ```bash
    cd day03
    ```

2. Specify which part of the challenge should be executed. E.g., for part 1:

    ```bash
    cargo run --bin part1
    ```
